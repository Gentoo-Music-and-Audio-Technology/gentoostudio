# gentoostudio
Ebuild overlay for Gentoo Studio (http://gentoostudio.org)

All ebuilds must:
* use EAPI6
* have the amd64 or ~amd64 keyword, unless it is a live ebuild. x86 is not supported by Gentoo Studio
* pass repoman full

Most, if not all, of these will be given to gentoo/audio-overlay. If 
you've stumbled across this repo, you should use audio-overlay instead. 
This overlay is used for building Gentoo Studio tarballs.
