# gentoostudio
Ebuild overlay for Gentoo Studio (http://gentoostudio.org)

All ebuilds must:
* use EAPI6
* have the amd64 or ~amd64 keyword, unless it is a live ebuild. x86 is not supported by Gentoo Studio

Most, if not all, of these will be given to gentoo/audio-overlay. If you've stumbled across this repo, you should use audio-overlay instead.
