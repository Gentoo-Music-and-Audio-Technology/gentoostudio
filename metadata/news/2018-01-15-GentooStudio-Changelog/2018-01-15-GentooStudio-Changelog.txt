A lot has changed this month. Please see https://gentoostudio.org
Existing users are encouraged to unmerge media-sound/cadence and
emerge media-sound/cadence-bin. This will remove media-sound/ladish
as a dependency. Ladish has not been updated in a while and Cadence
is the only package depending on it. The binary package will be more
reliable going foward.
